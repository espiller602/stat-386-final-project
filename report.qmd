# Abstract

This project analyzes which advanced quarterback (QB) statistics best explain playoff success in the NFL. Using postseason data from Pro Football Reference, we compiled an original dataset containing advanced QB efficiency metrics for every playoff quarterback from 2018 through 2024—the first seven seasons in which advanced passing statistics were publicly available. After aggregating CSV files for each season and performing data cleaning, we built a Python package to support wrangling and modeling tasks.

We initially selected variables informed by football domain knowledge—Intended Air Yards per Completion (IAY_PA), Completed Air Yards per Completion (CAY_PA), Yards After Catch per Completion (YAC_Cmp), Pressure %, Drop %, and Bad %—as likely predictors of playoff success. Using lasso-regularized Poisson regression to account for the discrete and highly skewed response variable (playoff wins), we found that IAY_PA, YAC_Cmp, and interceptions per pass attempt (IntPerAtt) were the strongest predictors.

Percent-based interpretations suggest that small improvements in YAC per completion can increase expected playoff wins by roughly 19%, while small increases in interception rate decrease expected wins by approximately 11%. These findings highlight that playoff success is closely tied to both vertical passing efficiency and limiting turnover-worthy plays. The project demonstrates how advanced QB metrics can provide insight into game planning for the high-pressure, high-variance environment of the postseason.

# 1. Introduction / Motivation

NFL playoff performance is notoriously volatile: game outcomes hinge on small sample sizes, opponent strength varies dramatically, and quarterbacks are often judged on only a handful of high-pressure plays. Understanding which QB attributes consistently contribute to postseason success is both analytically challenging and strategically valuable.

Pro Football Reference began publicly releasing advanced quarterback passing metrics in 2018, making it the first season in which detailed efficiency and accuracy measures became available for postseason analysis. As a result, our study focuses on playoff quarterbacks from 2018–2024, the complete set of seasons with accessible advanced stats.

**Research question:**  
*Which advanced QB metrics best predict playoff wins, and what do they reveal about effective postseason passing strategies?*

We initially selected a subset of variables from the full set of 50+ advanced stats based on prior football knowledge: IAY/PA, CAY/PA, YAC/Cmp, Prss%, Drop%, and Bad%. These were hypothesized to most strongly influence postseason success due to their relationship with vertical efficiency, explosive playmaking, ball security, and accuracy under pressure.

By focusing on this era and these informed variables, we aim to identify performance patterns in an environment where margins are smallest and pressure is highest.

# 2. Data Collection

All data was collected from Pro Football Reference’s Advanced Passing tables for each postseason between 2018 and 2024. We began in 2018 because it was the first season in which PFR made advanced passing metrics publicly available; earlier years lack many of the key variables used in our analysis.

For each season, we downloaded the advanced playoff quarterback statistics as an Excel file. Each file contains one row per QB who appeared in the postseason during that year and includes about 50 advanced metrics, such as air yards, accuracy measures, pocket performance, pressure statistics, and turnover-worthy metrics. One of the quirks of PFR’s downloads is that they are listed as Excel files but are actually HTML tables, so they needed to be read as HTML rather than Excel.

After downloading the seven yearly Excels and reading the HTML from them for 2018–2024, we aggregated them into a single dataset with:

- 133 rows
- 50 columns of raw advanced QB statistics
- Additional columns for `Season` and `Playoff_Wins`

Playoff wins were extracted from the PFR `QBrec` column.

**Data limitations include:**

- Early-season missingness in stats not yet tracked in 2018 (e.g., OnTgt, OnTgt%)
- Missing values for QBs with extremely limited playoff snaps
- Small sample size inherent to postseason football
- Imbalanced response variable (most quarterbacks win 0 or 1 playoff game)

Despite these limitations, PFR’s consistent formatting across seasons made aggregation feasible and reproducible.

# 3. Data Wrangling and Cleaning

The data wrangling process involved consolidating the seven yearly CSVs into a single structured dataset suitable for modeling. Most columns were already standardized by PFR, so the cleaning process focused on harmonizing formats and preparing the response variable.

Key steps included:

- **Renaming columns for consistency:**

| Original | New |
|----------|-----|
| IAY/PA   | IAY_PA |
| CAY/PA   | CAY_PA |
| YAC/Cmp  | YAC_Cmp |
| Prss%    | PrssPct |
| Drop%    | DropPct |
| Bad%     | BadPct |

- **Aggregation:** Each year’s CSV was appended into one combined dataset with a `Season` identifier.  
- **Extraction of playoff wins:** The number of playoff games won by each QB was computed from the PFR `QBrec` column and stored in `Playoff_Wins`.  
- **Handling missing values:** Missing entries—common for 2018 metrics not yet tracked and QBs with minimal postseason participation—were retained during wrangling, then dropped during modeling.  
- **Feature engineering:** Added interceptions per pass attempt (`IntPerAtt`) as a derived column.  
- **Minimal transformations:** Mostly aligning column names and ensuring numeric encoding.

The selected initial variables reflect domain knowledge about factors likely to impact playoff outcomes, providing a principled starting point for lasso-based selection.

# 4. Methods / Analysis

We first explored ordinary least squares regression, but assumptions were violated (non-constant variance, skewed residuals). The response variable, playoff wins, is a non-negative count, making Poisson regression more appropriate.

Because the dataset contains many correlated predictors and the sample size is small (133 observations), we used lasso regularization to perform variable selection and avoid overfitting.

**Modeling process:**

- Selected initial predictors informed by football knowledge: IAY_PA, CAY_PA, YAC_Cmp, PrssPct, DropPct, BadPct  
- Standardized predictors  
- Fitted lasso-penalized Poisson regression with cross-validation to choose the penalty parameter  
- Identified variables with non-zero coefficients in the final model

The lasso-optimized model retained three primary predictors:

- Intended Air Yards per Completion (IAY_PA)  
- Yards After Catch per Completion (YAC_Cmp)  
- Interceptions per Pass Attempt (IntPerAtt)

These results suggest that a combination of downfield efficiency, YAC-driven explosiveness, and turnover avoidance has the strongest relationship with playoff success.

# 5. Results

After lasso-based variable selection, a Poisson generalized linear model was fit using IAY_PA, YAC_Cmp, and IntPerAtt. The model was fit on 96 observations after removing missing rows.

The model explains a modest portion of playoff win variability (Cox–Snell pseudo-R² = 0.151). The residual deviance per degree of freedom was 1.24, indicating mild overdispersion.

**Coefficient table:**

| Predictor | Coefficient | p-value | Percent Change in Expected Wins |
|-----------|------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| Yards After Catch per Completion (YAC_Cmp) | 0.177 | 0.046 | +19% per 1-yard increase |
| Interceptions per Pass Attempt (IntPerAtt) | -11.812 | 0.042 | -11% per 0.01 increase |
| Intended Air Yards per Completion (IAY_PA) | -0.118 | 0.096 | -11% per 1-yard increase |
| Intercept | 0.159 | 0.842 | — |

*Notes:* Percent change calculated as e^(coefficient) - 1 for 1-unit changes; for IntPerAtt, interpreted per 0.01 increase to match realistic scale. Positive values indicate an increase in expected playoff wins, negative values indicate a decrease.

# 6. Discussion

Percent-based interpretations reinforce that playoff QB success is driven less by aggressiveness and more by efficiency, ball security, and post-catch production. Even small increases in interception rate substantially reduce expected playoff wins, while additional YAC per completion significantly improves expected wins.

The negative association with IAY_PA suggests a tradeoff between vertical aggressiveness and consistency; deep passes may reduce expected playoff success due to higher variance, lower completion probability, or turnover risk.

It is important to note that many factors beyond QB performance influence playoff wins, including defense, coaching, and game context. The modest pseudo-R² reflects this reality.

Overall, these findings indicate that in the postseason, maximizing efficiency and minimizing mistakes is more predictive of success than high-risk, high-reward strategies.
