## Overview

The `nfl_playoff_predictor.wrangling` module provides functions for cleaning and preparing NFL playoff passing statistics from Pro-Football-Reference HTML tables.

## Functions

### `build_advanced_dataset()`

Builds a combined dataset from NFL playoff passing statistics across multiple seasons.

**Parameters:**
- `data_dir` (str): Directory containing data files
- `start_year` (int, default=2018): First year to include
- `end_year` (int, default=2024): Last year to include (inclusive)

**Returns:**
- `pd.DataFrame`: Combined dataset with advanced and standard passing statistics

**Example:**

```python
from nfl_playoff_predictor.wrangling import build_advanced_dataset

df = build_advanced_dataset("data sources", start_year=2018, end_year=2024)
print(df.head())
```

**What it does:**
1. Reads advanced passing statistics from HTML files (e.g., `2018_Playoffs_Advanced.xls`)
2. Reads standard passing statistics (e.g., `2018_Standard_Passing.xls`)
3. Merges datasets by Player, Team, and Season
4. Extracts playoff wins from QBrec field
5. Returns combined dataset for all specified years

---

### `clean_column_names()`

Cleans column names by removing duplicate suffixes and renaming columns after merging.

**Parameters:**
- `df` (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame with merged advanced and standard passing statistics

**Returns:**
- `pd.DataFrame`: DataFrame with cleaned column names

**Example:**

```python
from nfl_playoff_predictor.wrangling import build_advanced_dataset, clean_column_names

df = build_advanced_dataset("data sources")
clean_df = clean_column_names(df)
```

**What it does:**
1. Drops columns ending with `_y` (duplicates from standard passing)
2. Removes `_x` suffix from remaining columns
3. Renames `Yds.1` to `YdsLost` for clarity

---

### `process_and_save_dataset()`

Complete pipeline: build dataset, clean columns, and save to CSV.

**Parameters:**
- `data_dir` (str): Directory containing data files
- `output_file` (str, default="clean_playoff_passing.csv"): Path to output CSV file
- `start_year` (int, default=2018): First year to include
- `end_year` (int, default=2024): Last year to include

**Returns:**
- `pd.DataFrame`: Cleaned dataset

**Example:**

```python
from nfl_playoff_predictor.wrangling import process_and_save_dataset

df = process_and_save_dataset("data sources", "clean_playoff_passing.csv")
```

**What it does:**
1. Calls `build_advanced_dataset()` to create the dataset
2. Calls `clean_column_names()` to clean column names
3. Saves the result to a CSV file
4. Returns the cleaned DataFrame

## Data Requirements

Your data files should be named in the following format:
- `{year}_Playoffs_Advanced.xls` - Advanced passing statistics
- `{year}_Standard_Passing.xls` - Standard passing statistics

For example:
- `2018_Playoffs_Advanced.xls`
- `2018_Standard_Passing.xls`
- `2019_Playoffs_Advanced.xls`
- etc.

## Output Columns

The cleaned dataset includes:
- Player information (Player, Team, Season)
- Advanced passing metrics (IAY/PA, CAY/PA, YAC/Cmp, etc.)
- Standard passing metrics (Cmp, Att, Yds, TD, Int, etc.)
- Derived metrics (playoff_games_won)
